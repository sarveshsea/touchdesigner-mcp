## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-30

### Upgrade Notes

**For MCP client users** (Claude Desktop, other MCP hosts — npx or MCPB installs):

- **No configuration changes needed.** The server now speaks MCP protocol revision [2026-07-28](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2026-07-28/changelog) and transparently falls back to the 2025-era protocol for existing clients, in both stdio and HTTP modes. Clients that already understand 2026-07-28 negotiate it automatically via `server/discover`.

  Client compatibility verified against this release (live, via the Docker container route):

  | Client | Version tested | Protocol served | Evidence |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | MCP SDK v2 (`@modelcontextprotocol/client`) | 2.0.0 | 2026-07-28 (auto and pinned modes) and 2025-06-18 legacy | E2E suite; live SDK probes over stdio and Streamable HTTP |
  | Claude Code | 2.1.220 | 2025-06-18 via the transparent legacy fallback (client does not implement `server/discover` yet) | All 14 tools listed and called live; a raw `initialize` over the identical stdio route negotiated `2025-06-18` |
  | Codex CLI | 0.146.0 | 2026-07-28 support gated behind `[features] mcp_2026_07_28 = true` (default `false` → 2025 era) | All 14 tools discovered and called live with the flag enabled; the per-request wire revision itself was not directly observed |
  | Claude Desktop | — | 2025-era fallback expected | Config registration only; not directly measured |
- **The TouchDesigner side is untouched.** No `.tox` re-import is required; all 14 tools and 3 prompts behave identically. In HTTP mode, the TouchDesigner version-compatibility check result is now shared across requests for its TTL, so the per-request stateless serving does not re-run the handshake on every call.
- **The version-compatibility notice got more precise.** The check now compares your deployed component against the API version this release ships with (`1.5.0`) instead of the npm package version, so the `2.0.0` package number does not affect deployed components. A component whose API version differs in minor/patch now receives an "Update Recommended" notice (previously patch differences were silent), and a component from a *newer* API generation than the server supports gets a clear "update the MCP server" error instead of a generic mismatch message.
- **Node.js 20+ is now required** to run the server (SDK v2 requirement; declared in `engines` and the MCPB manifest). Check `node --version` where the MCP host spawns the server.
- **HTTP mode is now stateless.** Protocol revision 2026-07-28 removes protocol-level sessions ([SEP-2567](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2567)): the `Mcp-Session-Id` header is no longer issued or accepted, `GET`/`DELETE` on `/mcp` answer `405` (SDK clients tolerate both), and the `/health` response no longer reports a `sessions` count — update any monitoring that read it. Deployments can now sit behind ordinary round-robin load balancers.
- **Server logs moved to stderr.** The MCP logging capability is deprecated by the specification ([SEP-2577](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2577)), so log messages no longer arrive over the MCP connection's logging channel — read them from the host's stderr capture (e.g. Claude Desktop's MCP log files) instead.

**For developers** (contributors to this repository):

- The SDK dependency changed from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.x to the v2 packages (`@modelcontextprotocol/server`, `@modelcontextprotocol/node`, `@modelcontextprotocol/express`, `@modelcontextprotocol/core`). Tools are registered with `registerTool` and prompts with `registerPrompt` (Zod schemas) — the v1 `server.tool()` and low-level schema-based `setRequestHandler` forms no longer exist.
- The transport layer is much smaller: stdio serving goes through `serveStdio(factory)`, HTTP through `createMcpHandler(factory)` + `toNodeHandler` inside `ExpressHttpManager`. The session machinery (`TransportFactory`, `TransportRegistry`, `SessionManager`, ~1,000 lines) is gone; there is no per-session state to reason about.
- `ILogger` is now SDK-independent (`LogParams` in `src/core/logger.ts`); `ConsoleLogger` (stderr) is the only implementation and renders structured data via `util.inspect`.
- New `npm run test:e2e` suite (also run in CI) drives the built `dist/cli.js` with the real MCP SDK v2 client over both transports and both protocol eras; the `integration-test-guard` pre-push hook accepts `tests/e2e/` changes as coverage evidence alongside `tests/integration/`.

### Changed

- Updated the MCP protocol implementation to specification revision 2026-07-28: migrated from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.29.0 to the SDK v2 packages (`@modelcontextprotocol/server`, `@modelcontextprotocol/node`, `@modelcontextprotocol/express`, `@modelcontextprotocol/core` 2.0.0). stdio serving goes through `serveStdio` and HTTP serving through `createMcpHandler`, each serving 2026-07-28 and the 2025-era protocol from the same tool/prompt registrations. Responses now carry the revision's `resultType` field, list results the required `ttlMs`/`cacheScope` cache hints ([SEP-2549](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2549)), and the standard `Mcp-Method`/`Mcp-Name` request headers are validated on the modern HTTP path ([SEP-2243](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2243)) ([#206](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/206)).
- Tools are registered through the v2 `registerTool` API and prompts through `registerPrompt` with Zod argument schemas (replacing the deprecated variadic `server.tool()` and hand-written low-level `prompts/list` / `prompts/get` handlers). Tool and prompt wire behavior is unchanged apart from the new protocol fields ([#206](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/206)).
- HTTP mode shares a single `TouchDesignerClient` across the request-scoped server instances, so the TouchDesigner version-compatibility check result stays cached for its TTL instead of re-running on every stateless request ([#206](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/206)).
- `ConsoleLogger` renders non-string log data with `util.inspect`, preserving structured details that the MCP logging channel used to carry ([#206](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/206)).
- Released version `2.0.0` across package metadata (`package.json`), MCP bundle manifest (`mcpb/manifest.json`), and server registry metadata (`server.json`), including the updated MCPB download URL and checksum so npm and MCPB installations resolve the same release. The major bump reflects the breaking changes above (Node.js 20+ requirement, HTTP session removal, MCP logging capability removal). The MCP API version (`src/api/index.yml`, `td/modules/utils/version.py`, `pyproject.toml`, and `mcpCompatibility.expectedApiVersion` in `package.json`) stays at `1.5.0` since this release contains no server/API contract changes — no `.tox` re-import is required.

### Fixed

- The TouchDesigner version-compatibility check no longer compares the npm package version against the component's API version. It now compares the component against the API version the release ships with (`mcpCompatibility.expectedApiVersion`) bounded by `minApiVersion`, so bumping the npm package version alone can never invalidate deployed `.tox` components. Previously a package MAJOR bump would have hard-stopped every tool call against every existing component even though the actual API contract was unchanged. A component with a newer API generation than the server supports now gets a clear "update the MCP server" error, and `scripts/syncApiServerVersions.ts` keeps `expectedApiVersion` in sync with the API version axis ([#208](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/208)).

### Removed

- Removed the session management layer (`TransportFactory`, `TransportRegistry`, `SessionManager`, `SessionConfig`) — protocol revision 2026-07-28 makes Streamable HTTP stateless, serving every request with a fresh server instance ([#206](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/206)).
- Removed the deprecated MCP `logging` capability and the `McpLogger`; logging now writes to stderr (SEP-2577 migration path) ([#206](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/206)).

### Security

- Patched all open Dependabot alerts: bumped `brace-expansion` and `body-parser` ([#200](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/200)), then resolved the remaining 9 alerts in transitive dependencies via targeted bumps and npm `overrides` ([#201](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/201)).
- Bumped the transitive development dependency `postcss` (via `vitest` → `vite`) to 8.5.25, patching the source-map path-traversal advisory published after the fixes above (Dependabot alert 169, high severity, development scope only — the published package's runtime dependencies are unaffected).

### Technical

- Added an E2E test suite (`npm run test:e2e`, also run in CI) that spawns the built `dist/cli.js` and drives it with the real MCP SDK v2 client (`@modelcontextprotocol/client`) over both transports: 2026-07-28 negotiation via `server/discover` (auto and pinned modes), the 2025-era legacy fallback, `tools/list` / `tools/call` / `prompts/get`, and the stateless `/health` shape. Readiness uses health-endpoint polling rather than fixed sleeps; no TouchDesigner instance is required. The `integration-test-guard` pre-push hook accepts `tests/e2e/` changes as coverage evidence ([#206](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/206)).
- Ported the maintainer release tooling to Codex and formalized the CHANGELOG's `Upgrade Notes` / `Contributors` sections in the release skills ([#198](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/198)); added and refined a pull-request template ([#203](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/203), [#204](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/204)).
- **Dependency Updates**: replaced the MCP SDK and hardened transitive dependencies.
  - `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.29.0 → `@modelcontextprotocol/server` / `node` / `express` / `core` ^2.0.0 (runtime), `@modelcontextprotocol/client` ^2.0.0 (dev, E2E tests)
  - Dependabot fixes for `brace-expansion`, `body-parser`, and 9 transitive alerts via `overrides` ([#200](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/200), [#201](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/201))

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-11

### Upgrade Notes

What existing users can expect when the MCP server updates before the TouchDesigner component does:

- **The server side updates itself; nothing breaks.** Configurations using `npx -y touchdesigner-mcp-server@latest` pick up 1.5.0 on the next MCP client restart. The server performs a version handshake with the TouchDesigner component and keeps operating against an older `mcp_webserver_base.tox` (API 1.3.0–1.4.x): all existing tools continue to work, and an "Update Recommended" notice with re-import instructions is appended to every tool response until the component is updated.
- **Available immediately, without re-importing the `.tox`:** the new `get_top_image` tool (its capture script is written to run on older deployed components) and the `execute_python_script` stdout/stderr display fix ([#189](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/189) — the bug was on the Node.js side; TouchDesigner components have returned captured output all along).
- **Requires re-importing `td/mcp_webserver_base.tox`:** full Python tracebacks in error responses ([#190](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/190)), TouchDesigner globals in the script namespace ([#191](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/191)), and node auto-alignment ([#187](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/187)). Re-importing also clears the per-response update notice.
- Components older than v1.3.0 (which predate version reporting) are rejected at connection time, as in previous releases — update both the server and the component.

### Added

- Added a new `get_top_image` MCP tool that captures the current output of any TOP node as a JPEG and returns it as an MCP image content block, so AI agents can actually see what a TOP is rendering instead of reasoning blind about visual output. An optional `maxSize` parameter downscales the longer side while preserving aspect ratio; when a downscale is needed, a temporary `resolutionTOP` is created next to the node and always destroyed afterward, leaving the project unmodified. The capture is routed through the same Python execution channel as `execute_python_script`, so no new HTTP endpoint is required ([#186](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/issues/186), [#195](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/195)).
- Newly created nodes are now automatically placed on a non-overlapping grid instead of stacking at TouchDesigner's default position, so networks built through repeated `create_td_node` calls stay readable. Existing nodes are never moved, an explicit `nodeX`/`nodeY` supplied by the caller is respected over auto-alignment, and a placement failure only logs a warning without failing node creation ([#187](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/187)).

### Fixed

- `execute_python_script` responses now surface captured `print` output: the TouchDesigner side returns captured output under the `stdout`/`stderr` keys, but the response formatter read a nonexistent `output` key, so print output was silently dropped in summary/minimal responses. The keys are now read correctly, a `Stderr` section is rendered when scripts write to standard error, and the exec endpoint's OpenAPI schema documents both fields ([#183](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/issues/183), [#189](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/189)).
- `execute_python_script` error responses now include the full Python traceback instead of only the exception message, so failures inside TouchDesigner can be located without re-running the script with manual instrumentation ([#184](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/issues/184), [#190](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/190)).
- `execute_python_script` now exposes TouchDesigner's global namespace (`tdu`, `absTime`, `ui`, OP type names such as `noiseTOP`, `ParMode`, ...) by merging the `__main__` module globals into the script namespace, so code copy-pasted from the Textport or a DAT runs unchanged instead of raising `NameError` ([#185](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/issues/185), [#191](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/191)).

### Changed

- Released version `1.5.0` across package metadata (`package.json`), MCP bundle manifest (`mcpb/manifest.json`), and server registry metadata (`server.json`), including the updated MCPB download URL and checksum so npm and MCPB installations resolve the same release. The MCP API version (`src/api/index.yml`, `td/modules/utils/version.py`, `pyproject.toml`) is bumped from `1.4.3` to `1.5.0` because this release changes the server/API contract: the exec endpoint response gains `stdout`/`stderr` fields, TD-side script execution behavior changed (traceback in errors, TouchDesigner globals in the namespace, node auto-alignment), and the new `get_top_image` tool was added. Re-import `td/mcp_webserver_base.tox` (or update the `td/modules` files) so the TouchDesigner side runs the new contract. No dependency updates are included.

### Technical

- Expanded integration coverage for the release surface: live-TD reconciliation tests for Python script execution (stdout/stderr capture, traceback propagation, TouchDesigner globals), node auto-alignment (zero-overlap readback, explicit-coordinate override), and `get_top_image` (JPEG dimensions at native and `maxSize`-constrained resolution, temp-TOP cleanup, non-TOP family error), plus a mocked MCP-response test asserting the `execute_python_script` tool renders captured stdout/stderr ([#193](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/193), [#196](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/196)).
- Added release tooling for maintainers: an `integration-test-guard` pre-push hook + skill that blocks pushes touching the API/MCP surface without integration-test changes, and a release-manager agent with `prepare-release` / `release-test-audit` skills encoding the two-axis version policy and the release flow ([#188](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/188), [#192](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/192)).

## [1.4.12] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Fixed the TouchDesigner WebServer component failing to initialize with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mcp.controllers'` (and the same failure for `utils.error_handling`) when TouchDesigner's Python already contains same-named `mcp` / `utils` packages (e.g. the Anthropic MCP SDK, PyPI name `mcp`). Corrected `import_modules` so the project `modules/` paths take priority in `sys.path` and any cached `mcp*` entries are evicted from `sys.modules`, added the missing `__init__.py` files so `modules/mcp/` and `modules/utils/` are regular packages instead of shadowable namespace packages, and re-synced the `import_modules` DAT embedded in `mcp_webserver_base.tox` so the released `.tox` runs the fixed logic ([#173](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/issues/173), [#181](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/181)).

### Changed

- Released version `1.4.12` across package metadata (`package.json`), MCP bundle manifest (`mcpb/manifest.json`), and server registry metadata (`server.json`), including the updated MCPB download URL and checksum so npm and MCPB installations resolve the same release. The MCP API version (`src/api/index.yml`, `td/modules/utils/version.py`, `pyproject.toml`) stays at `1.4.3` since this release contains no server/API contract changes. No dependency updates are included.

## [1.4.11] - 2026-06-27

### Changed

- Released version `1.4.11` across package metadata (`package.json`), MCP bundle manifest (`mcpb/manifest.json`), and server registry metadata (`server.json`), including the updated MCPB checksum so npm and MCPB installations resolve the same release. The MCP API version (`src/api/index.yml`, `td/modules/utils/version.py`, `pyproject.toml`) stays at `1.4.3` since this release contains no server/API contract changes.

### Security

- Resolved all 18 `npm audit` advisories (15 moderate, 3 high) down to 0. Upgrading `@redocly/cli` to `2.35.1` cleared the `markdown-it` and `undici` transitive advisories, and `npm audit fix` lifted `form-data`, `linkify-it`, and `markdown-it` in the lockfile only (no direct dependency changes). No `overrides` were needed.

### Technical

- **Dependency Updates**: Updated runtime and development dependencies. No server/API contract changes; code generation output (`src/gen`, `td/modules`) is unchanged after the `orval` and `@redocly/cli` upgrades.
  - `axios` 1.17.0 → 1.18.1
  - `semver` 7.8.4 → 7.8.5
  - `@biomejs/biome` 2.5.0 → 2.5.1
  - `@redocly/cli` 2.32.2 → 2.35.1
  - `@types/node` 25.9.3 → 26.0.1
  - `@vitest/coverage-v8` 4.1.8 → 4.1.9
  - `orval` 8.17.0 → 8.19.0
  - `prettier` 3.8.4 → 3.8.5
  - `vitest` 4.1.8 → 4.1.9

## [1.4.10] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- Enabled TypeScript declaration emit (`declaration: true` in `tsconfig.json`) so the published package actually ships the `.d.ts` files it already advertises through `types: dist/index.d.ts` and the typed `exports` map. Previously `build:dist` emitted only JavaScript, so TypeScript consumers installing `touchdesigner-mcp-server` got `Could not find a declaration file` errors despite the package metadata promising declarations ([#176](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/176)).

### Changed

- Released version `1.4.10` across package metadata (`package.json`), MCP bundle manifest (`mcpb/manifest.json`), and server registry metadata (`server.json`), including the updated MCPB checksum so npm and MCPB installations resolve the same release. The MCP API version (`src/api/index.yml`, `td/modules/utils/version.py`, `pyproject.toml`) stays at `1.4.3` since this release contains no server/API contract changes.

## [1.4.9] - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- Released version `1.4.9` across package metadata (`package.json`), MCP bundle manifest (`mcpb/manifest.json`), and server registry metadata (`server.json`), including the updated MCPB download URL and checksum so npm and MCPB installations resolve the same release. The MCP API version (`src/api/index.yml`, `td/modules/utils/version.py`) stays at `1.4.3` since this release contains no server/API contract changes.
- Replaced the `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli` (Java-based python-flask generator) with `@redocly/cli` for OpenAPI bundling. The python-flask generator was only used for its bundled `openapi.yaml` side effect; the rest of its output (Flask skeleton, models, CI artifacts) was dead code. The schema is now bundled directly via `redocly bundle` (`gen:webserver` renamed to `gen:openapi`), and `td/genHandlers.js` switched from the phantom `fs-extra` dependency to `node:fs/promises`.
- Generated type names now follow the source schema (`CreateNode200Data`, `CreateNodeBody`) instead of generator-normalized names (`CreateNode200ResponseData`, `CreateNodeRequest`); consuming code updated accordingly. Python `operationId`s are snake_case in the source schema, so the TouchDesigner side is unchanged.
- Centralized MCP tool definitions in a new `src/features/tools/toolDefinitions.ts` as the single source of truth (name, description, input schema, handler). `handlers/tdTools.ts` now registers them in a loop, and the `describe_td_tools` manifest derives its parameter metadata from each tool's Zod schema via introspection, keeping registration and documentation consistent.

### Removed

- Removed dead code surfaced by the codegen migration: the Flask skeleton and models under `td/modules/td_server/`, the unused `msw` dependency together with `public/mockServiceWorker.js` and its config field, the unreferenced `@mozilla/readability`, `@types/ws`, `@types/yargs`, and `@types/jsdom` devDependencies, and the stale `overrides` entry for `concurrently` (it targeted a transitive dependency of the now-removed `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli`).
- Dropped the Java runtime from the Docker image, since the `@redocly/cli` bundling step no longer requires it.
- Removed the obsolete planning documents `plans/agent-interface-direction.md` and `plans/code-execution-design.md`.

### Technical

- Replaced `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli` with `@redocly/cli` in the code generation toolchain (`gen:openapi`).
- No dependency version bumps in this release: all direct dependencies were already at their latest published versions and `npm audit` reported 0 vulnerabilities.

## [1.4.8] - 2026-06-11

### Changed

- Released version `1.4.8` across package metadata (`package.json`), MCP bundle manifest (`mcpb/manifest.json`), and server registry metadata (`server.json`), including the updated MCPB download URL and checksum so npm and MCPB installations resolve the same release. The MCP API version (`src/api/index.yml`, `td/modules/utils/version.py`) stays at `1.4.3` since this release contains no server/API changes.
- Pinned all dependencies and devDependencies to exact versions (removed caret ranges) so local and CI installs always resolve identical dependency trees.

### Fixed

- Updated `public/mockServiceWorker.js` `PACKAGE_VERSION` to `2.14.6` to match the upgraded `msw` dependency, keeping the generated worker script in sync with the installed package.

### Removed

- Removed unused `archiver` devDependency — MCP Bundle packaging has been handled by `npx @anthropic-ai/mcpb pack` since the packaging flow was reworked, leaving `archiver` unreferenced.

### Security

- Added an `overrides` entry forcing `shell-quote` to the patched `1.8.4` release under `concurrently`, fixing a critical advisory (GHSA-w7jw-789q-3m8p) without downgrading `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli`. The override can be removed once `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli` ships with `concurrently@10` or newer.
- Resolved all remaining `npm audit` findings (including a high-severity `fast-uri` path traversal advisory) by refreshing transitive dependencies via `npm audit fix`.

### Technical

- **Dependency Updates**: Updated runtime and development dependencies for compatibility with the latest TypeScript, testing, and code generation toolchain
  - Updated `axios` from `1.15.0` to `1.17.0`
  - Updated `semver` from `^7.7.4` to `7.8.4`
  - Updated `yaml` from `^2.8.3` to `2.9.0`
  - Updated `zod` from `4.3.6` to `4.4.3`
  - Updated `@biomejs/biome` from `2.4.11` to `2.4.16`
  - Updated `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli` from `^2.31.1` to `2.35.0`
  - Updated `@types/jsdom` from `^28.0.1` to `28.0.3`
  - Updated `@types/node` from `^25.6.0` to `25.9.3`
  - Updated `@vitest/coverage-v8` from `^4.1.4` to `4.1.8`
  - Updated `msw` from `^2.13.2` to `2.14.6`
  - Updated `orval` from `^8.7.0` to `8.16.0`
  - Updated `prettier` from `^3.8.2` to `3.8.4`
  - Updated `typescript` from `^6.0.2` to `6.0.3`
  - Updated `vitest` from `^4.1.4` to `4.1.8`

## [1.4.7] - 2026-04-12

### Changed

- Released version `1.4.7` across package metadata (`package.json`), MCP bundle manifest (`mcpb/manifest.json`), and server registry metadata (`server.json`), including the updated MCPB download URL and checksum so npm and MCPB installations resolve the same release.
- Upgraded `axios` from the temporary `1.13.6` hold to the safe upstream release `1.15.0`, keeping installs on a patched version without relying on the earlier emergency pin.
- Switched Node.js version management from `.nvmrc` to `.node-version` for broader compatibility with version managers (`fnm`, `volta`, `mise`, etc.).
- CI workflows (`development.yml`, `release.yml`) now read the pinned Node.js version from `.node-version` instead of using a floating `24.x` matrix, preventing lock file drift between local and CI environments.

### Fixed

- Updated `public/mockServiceWorker.js` `PACKAGE_VERSION` to `2.13.2` to match the upgraded `msw` dependency, preventing local test and development mismatches between the generated worker script and the installed package.
- Removed deprecated `baseUrl` and `paths` settings from `tsconfig.json`, preventing `TS5101` failures and keeping `npm run build:dist` compatible with TypeScript `6.0`.
- Used optional chaining (`data?.name`) in `classListFormatter.ts` for safer class details data validation.
- Regenerated `package-lock.json` for npm `11.11.0` compatibility, fixing missing top-level entries for `@emnapi/core` and `@emnapi/runtime` that caused `npm ci` failures in CI.

### Removed

- Removed the temporary `overrides.axios` entry introduced during the March 2026 npm supply-chain mitigation now that the project has moved to a safe upstream axios release.
- Removed unnecessary `@types/axios` from dependencies — axios `1.x` ships its own TypeScript type definitions.

### Technical

- **Dependency Updates**: Updated runtime and development dependencies for compatibility with the latest TypeScript, testing, and code generation toolchain
  - Updated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` from `^1.27.1` to `^1.29.0`
  - Updated `axios` from `1.13.6` to `1.15.0`
  - Updated `yaml` from `^2.8.2` to `^2.8.3`
  - Updated `@biomejs/biome` from `2.4.6` to `2.4.11`
  - Updated `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli` from `^2.30.2` to `^2.31.1`

  - Updated `prettier` from `^3.8.1` to `^3.8.2`
  - Updated `typescript` from `^5.9.3` to `^6.0.2`
  - Updated `vitest` from `^4.0.18` to `^4.1.4`

## [1.4.6] - 2026-04-01

### Security

- Pinned `axios` to exact version `1.13.6` (removed caret range `^1.13.6`) in both `dependencies` and `overrides` to mitigate the [axios supply chain attack](https://socket.dev/npm/package/axios/overview/1.14.1). The malicious `axios@1.14.1` was published to npm in late March 2026 and has since been removed. Users who ran `npx touchdesigner-mcp-server` during the compromise window (late March 2026) should check for the presence of `plain-crypto-js` in their `node_modules` and reinstall if found.

<https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/issues/167> @annsts thx!

#### For users who may have been affected

If you ran npx touchdesigner-mcp-server during late March 2026, please refer to the remediation guidance in the references below. Key steps include checking for the presence of plain-crypto-js in your node_modules, removing and reinstalling if found, and rotating any secrets or credentials that may have been exposed.

## [1.4.2] - 2025-12-07

### Added

- Implemented a mechanism to insert update guidance as an additional message to tool responses when compatibility warnings occur, enabling direct notification within the chat. (#141)

### Changed

- Extended compatibility check caching (60 seconds on failure, 5 minutes on success) and enforced re-verification upon `get_td_info` execution to reduce load while returning the latest determination. (#141)
- Added update procedures from older versions to the README, installation guide, and release notes, and detailed the compatibility verification flow in the architecture documentation. (#141)
- Improved guidance for missing version information, revising the message to explicitly indicate outdated `.tox` files or insufficient updates on MCP servers. (#141)
- Relaxed the compatibility policy so PATCH version differences are allowed without logging, and ensured TouchDesigner client tests do not surface notices for patch-only mismatches. (#144)

### Fixed

- Modified tool handlers to use a unified format `createToolResult` for returning additional content for compatibility warnings, improving response consistency. (#141)

### Technical

- Added unit and integration tests to verify compatibility message generation, cache TTL, and content with warning attachments, preventing regressions in the version warning flow. (#141)

## [1.4.1] - 2025-12-07

### Changed

- Adjusted the API server version to be updated and matched, as it was prompting for an update of mcp_webserver_base.tox even when using the latest NPM packages.

### Technical

- Aligned the versions of the Python module and OpenAPI schema (MCP_API_VERSION/info.version) to 1.4.1, and updated the compatibility check and client generation to report the new version.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-12-07

### Added

- **Streamable HTTP transport**: Added the [streamable-http](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/transports#streamable-http) mode with SSE real-time responses and session reuse via the `mcp-session-id` header. Host/port/endpoint can be configured via CLI or environment variables. `TransportRegistry` and `SessionManager` manage multi-session lifecycles. ([#131](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/131), [#133](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/133))
- **Comprehensive documentation expansion**: Added new English and Japanese docs (architecture overview, installation guides, developer guide) to clarify the full setup-to-operations workflow. ([#134](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/134))

### Changed

- Restructured README and installation guides; separated and simplified configuration examples for each AI client and HTTP mode steps. ([#134](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/134))

### Fixed

- Revised docker-compose `MCP_HTTP_HOST`/port exposure: loopback-only by default for HTTP mode while binding to `0.0.0.0` inside the container. ([#135](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/135))
- Ensured default TTL and cleanup interval are applied in `SessionManager` so sessions expire correctly even when configuration is omitted. ([#137](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/137))

  - Added `mcpCompatibility.minApiVersion` field to package.json to declare minimum compatible API version
  - Integrated `semver` package for precise version comparison logic
  - Implemented three-tier compatibility system (Compatible, Warning, Error) based on semver rules
  - Version checks now run on every tool call, ensuring continuous compatibility validation
  - Compatible: Same MAJOR version with API ≥ minimum compatible version
  - Warning: Different MINOR/PATCH versions (shows warning, continues execution)
  - Error: Different MAJOR versions or API below minimum (execution stops immediately)

  | MCP Server | API Server | Minimum compatible API version | Behavior | Status | Notes |
  |------------|------------|----------------|----------|--------|-------|
  | 1.3.x | 1.3.0 | 1.3.0 | ✅ Works normally | Compatible | Recommended baseline configuration |
  | 1.3.x | 1.4.0 | 1.3.0 | ⚠️ Warning shown, continues | Warning | Older MCP MINOR with newer API may lack new features |
  | 1.4.0 | 1.3.x | 1.3.0 | ⚠️ Warning shown, continues | Warning | Newer MCP MINOR may have additional features |
  | 1.3.2 | 1.3.1 | 1.3.2 | ❌ Execution stops | Error | API below minimum compatible version |
  | 2.0.0 | 1.x.x | N/A | ❌ Execution stops | Error | Different MAJOR = breaking changes |

  **Compatibility Rules**:

  - ✅ **Compatible**: Same MAJOR version AND API version ≥ minimum compatible version (currently 1.3.0)
  - ⚠️ **Warning**: Same MAJOR version with different MINOR or PATCH versions (e.g., MCP 1.4.0 with API 1.3.x, or vice versa) - shows warning but continues execution
  - ❌ **Error**: Different MAJOR versions (e.g., 2.x vs 1.x) OR API server below minimum compatible version

### Changed

- **Version Synchronization Scripts**: Refactored version management workflow for better maintainability ([#125](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/125))
  - Split `scripts/syncVersions.ts` into two targeted scripts:
    - `scripts/syncApiServerVersions.ts` - Manages Python API and OpenAPI spec versions
    - `scripts/syncMcpServerVersions.ts` - Manages MCP manifest and server config versions
  - Updated npm scripts to use new version commands: `version:api` and `version:mcp`
- **Enhanced Python Logging**: Added logging in OpenAPIRouter
  - Logs OpenAPI schema version at INFO level on initialization
  - Logs total route count at INFO level

> **Notice:** このバージョン以降、TouchDesigner API サーバーと MCP サーバーのバージョンが一致しない場合はすべてのツール呼び出しがエラーになります。解決手順は [README.ja.md](README.ja.md#トラブルシューティング) のヘルプを参照してください。

### Added

- Introduced the `getNodeErrors` tool to inspect specific nodes and their descendants for current errors, complete with new OpenAPI schemas, presenters, metadata, and integration tests so agents can troubleshoot TouchDesigner graphs without leaving chat. ([#119](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/119))
- Added the `getModuleHelp` tool that proxies Python `help()` output for TouchDesigner modules/classes and formats the response for MCP clients, enabling in-context documentation lookups inside AI agents. ([#117](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/117))

### Changed

- TouchDesigner client requests now run through an explicit MCP-vs-TD version compatibility check that logs mismatches, surfaces step-by-step upgrade guidance, and uses the new `scripts/syncVersions.ts` release helper to keep manifests, server.json, API specs, and Python constants aligned. ([#116](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/116))
- Simplified the `ILogger`/`McpLogger` interface so logs carry structured context by default, reducing noisy branching in handlers and tightening the unit/integration tests that assert logging behavior. ([#115](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/115))

### Fixed

- Hardened module-help retrieval by validating module/class names, removing `eval` usage, and tightening exception handling so user-supplied identifiers cannot execute arbitrary code and failures yield actionable errors. ([#117](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/117))
- Clarified node-error prompts and API descriptions by removing the unused `includeChildren` parameter, ensuring the tool consistently reports issues for the requested nodes plus their descendants. ([#119](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/119))

### Removed

- Dropped hundreds of unused OpenAPI response-model imports and handlers from the Python API controller, shrinking the generated surface area and speeding up future regen cycles. ([f79eba0](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/commit/f79eba05d782c6d5cc7ed2e10b78eab8bd01b48b))

### Technical

- Adopted Prettier (with `.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore`, and `pyproject.toml`), added npm scripts for Python/YAML formatting, and taught the development workflow to install Python tooling so formatting and linting stay consistent across languages. ([#114](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/114))
- Updated runtime and dev dependencies (MCP SDK, axios, zod, TypeScript, Vitest, MSW, etc.) and refreshed unit tests/mocks to cover the new versions for improved stability. ([#112](https://github.com/8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp/pull/112))
